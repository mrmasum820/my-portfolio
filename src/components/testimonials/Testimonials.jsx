    review: 'Easier designed to work with. I gave him a few references website, , and the first design were exactly what I was looking for. The only thing that needed to be adjusted in the slightest was content & design location. The mark and font choices were perfect in the concepts and made it directly to the final product. Very communicative were delivered in the agreed-upon time frame. From start to finish.',
